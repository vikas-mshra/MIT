# Understanding RNNs, Transformers, and Attention Mechanisms

If you're new to sequence modeling, this guide will help break things down for you in simpler terms. We'll explore important concepts like Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformers, and Attention mechanisms and explain how they fit into various applications like sentiment classification, image captioning, and machine translation.

## Key Concepts

### **RNN (Recurrent Neural Networks)**

- **Definition**: RNNs are a type of neural network designed to work with sequences. They handle inputs of varying lengths by processing one element of the sequence at a time while maintaining a "hidden state" (memory) that captures information about previous elements in the sequence. This makes RNNs well-suited for tasks where order and dependencies between elements matter, like time-series data or natural language.

### **Transformers**

- **Definition**: Transformers are neural networks designed for sequence processing, but unlike RNNs, they do not rely on a hidden state passed through each time step. Instead, Transformers use "attention mechanisms" to focus on important parts of the input sequence, which allows for parallelization (faster processing) and better handling of long-range dependencies. Transformers are commonly used in language models like GPT.

### **Attention**

- **Definition**: Attention is a mechanism that helps the model decide which parts of the input sequence are most important for making predictions. Instead of treating all parts of the input equally, attention assigns weights to each part, allowing the model to focus more on relevant information. This is crucial for understanding complex relationships in sequences.

## Sequence Modeling Applications

Sequence modeling can involve inputs and outputs of varying lengths. Here are some common examples:

1. **Many-to-One (e.g., Sentiment Classification)**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sequence (e.g., a sentence), predict a single output (e.g., positive or negative sentiment).
2. **One-to-Many (e.g., Image Captioning)**:
   - **Problem**: Given a single input (e.g., an image), generate a sequence of outputs (e.g., a descriptive caption).
3. **Many-to-Many (e.g., Machine Translation)**:
   - **Problem**: Given a sequence in one language (e.g., English), generate a corresponding sequence in another language (e.g., French).

## Neurons with Recurrence

### **Problem**: Handling Individual Time Steps

When processing sequential data, the challenge is that each time step depends on the previous ones. Traditional neural networks struggle with this because they treat inputs independently.

### **Solution**: Link Computations Across Time Steps (RNNs)

RNNs solve this by connecting the computations between time steps. The output at each step depends on both the current input and the hidden state (which captures previous inputs).

## How RNNs Update Their State

In RNNs, the state is updated at each time step. The new state is a combination of the current input and the previous state. This updated state is used to generate the output. In this way, RNNs retain information about what has happened in the past to influence future predictions.

## Sequence Modeling: Design Criteria

Here are four essential criteria for designing models that handle sequences:

1. **Handle Variable Length Sequences**:
   - Your model should work with sequences of different lengths (e.g., sentences with different numbers of words).
2. **Track Long-Term Dependencies**:
   - Some information in a sequence might affect what happens far later in the sequence, so the model needs to remember earlier parts for long periods.
3. **Maintain Information About Order**:
   - The order of the elements in a sequence is often important (e.g., word order in a sentence). The model needs to respect that.
4. **Share Parameters Across the Sequence**:
   - For efficiency, we want to use the same parameters (weights) throughout the sequence rather than learning different parameters for each time step.

RNNs meet these design criteria because they process sequences one step at a time, maintain a hidden state to remember past information, and share the same weights across all time steps.

## Work Prediction Example

**Problem**: Representing language in a way that a neural network can understand.  
**Solution**: Embeddings! We convert words into fixed-size vectors, which the network can work with.

1. **Vocabulary**: List of all the words we care about.
2. **Indexing**: Assign each word a unique index.
3. **Embedding**: Convert each index into a fixed-size vector.

You can use a **one-hot embedding** (where only one position in the vector is 1 and the rest are 0) or a **learned embedding** (where the vector is learned by the model during training).

## Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)

In RNNs, since the output at each time step affects future steps, we need to compute the gradient across all time steps when training. This is called **backpropagation through time**. It involves summing up the individual loss functions from each time step and calculating the gradient across the entire sequence.

### Issues:

1. **Exploding Gradients**: When gradients grow too large, they can cause the model to become unstable.
2. **Vanishing Gradients**: When gradients become too small, the model has trouble learning long-term dependencies (the gradient essentially disappears).

### Solutions:

- **Trick 1: Activation Functions**: Use activation functions that help mitigate these problems.
- **Trick 2: Parameter Initialization**: Carefully initialize the model's weights to avoid extreme values.
- **Trick 3: Gated Cells (LSTM)**: Use cells that selectively "forget" parts of the input, which helps with long-term memory.

---

## LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)

LSTM is a special type of RNN that addresses the problem of long-term dependencies. It uses **gates** to control what information should be kept, forgotten, or passed on to the next time step. The **output gate** filters the cell state and decides what to output at each time step.

## RNN Applications

Here are some common applications of RNNs:

- **Music Generation**: Generate sequences of notes to create music.
- **Sentiment Classification**: Predict whether a given text expresses positive or negative sentiment.

### **Limitations of RNNs**:

1. **Encoding Bottleneck**: RNNs struggle to capture all necessary information when processing long sequences.
2. **Slow, No Parallelization**: RNNs process one step at a time, so they can't easily take advantage of parallel computing.
3. **Not Long Memory**: RNNs tend to forget information after a certain number of steps.

### **Desired Capabilities**:

1. **Continuous Stream**: Handle input streams that are ongoing and unending.
2. **Parallelization**: Process sequences faster by handling multiple steps at once.
3. **Long Memory**: Remember information from much earlier in the sequence.

## Attention as a Solution

Instead of relying solely on RNNs, we can use **attention mechanisms** to identify and focus on the most important parts of an input sequence. This allows the model to extract key features and make better predictions.

### **Fundamentals of Attention**:

1. **Query**: What we are searching for.
2. **Keys**: The information in our database.
3. **Values**: The associated information we want to retrieve.

By comparing the query to the keys, we compute an attention score, apply a softmax function to normalize the scores, and then use the resulting weights to focus on the most relevant values.

---

## Learning Attention with Neural Networks

To implement attention in neural networks, we follow these steps:

1. **Encode Position Information**: Keep track of where each word is in the sequence.
2. **Compute Query, Key, and Value**: Use three separate layers to calculate these values for the input.
3. **Compute Attention Weighting**: Find the similarity between the query and the keys.
4. **Apply Softmax and Multiply**: Normalize the attention scores and multiply them with the values to get the final output.

This forms a **self-attention head**, which can be plugged into a larger network like a Transformer model. Each head focuses on different parts of the input sequence.

## Conclusion

We began with RNNs, which are great for handling sequences, but they have limitations when it comes to processing long sequences efficiently. Attention mechanisms and Transformers solve many of these issues by allowing the model to focus on important parts of the sequence and handle computations in parallel, leading to better performance and scalability in modern AI applications.
